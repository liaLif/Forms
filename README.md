# Forms

In this exercise I have created a registration Form for potential candidats for the she codes; super hero league.

During this exercise I have learned about the different input types, how to create a field that the browser completes 

automatically and how to create a field which the user must fill so the Form cannot be submitted if it has no input.

The design was inspired by the flashy colors of comic books.
